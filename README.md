## Projects
### jan13a
Two simple blinking LEDs.
### jan17a
Five LEDs that "crawl" across the prototype board. Two LEDs are on at a time.
### jan18a
Four LEDs based on timing data, syncing with timing tables in Excel.
### jan23a
Cycles through different colors, fading in and out.
`noLoopConstruct.cpp` attempts to recreate `original.cpp`/`sketch_jan23a.ino` without using any loop constructs.
> Besides control flow, modulus is another viable solution. 
### jan25a
Four LEDs based on timing data, syncing with timing tables in Excel, again.
### jan27a
Digital input with two buttons. One button turns the LED on, and one button turns the LED off.
### jan30a
Digital input with two buttons, again. One button simultaneously turns the LED on and speaker off, and one button simultaneously turns the LED off and speaker on.
