# arduino-projects
Hosts all the Arduino projects for CS1 Spring 2023.
This does not include the board design. Cope.

## jan13a
Two simple blinking LEDs.
## jan17a
Five LEDs that "crawl" across the prototype board. Two LEDs are on at a time.
## jan18a
Four LEDs based on timing data, syncing with timing tables in Excel.
## jan23a
Cycles through different colors, fading in and out.
`noLoopConstruct.cpp` attempts to recreate `original.cpp`/`sketch_jan23a.ino` without using any loop constructs.
> Besides control flow, modulus is another viable solution.
